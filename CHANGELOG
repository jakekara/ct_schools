	CHANGELOG
	
	0.0.6

	Refactoring code to cut out the *school_by_name_* helper
	functions. The data structuring, fuzzing functions provide enough
	functionality to build the api functions listed in 0.0.5 note in a
	DRY manner.
	
	0.0.5

	Everything so far has just really been the 0.0, but I needed to
	keep changing the version to push to PyPi.

	Separated out the following functions

	.closest(SCHOOL_NAME_STRING, lim=1)

	.exact(SCHOOL_NAME_STRING)

	.contains(SCHOOL_NAME_STRING)

	.fuzz(SCHOOL_NAME, ratio=75)
