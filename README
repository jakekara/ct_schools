ct schools - python library for getting profile data on ct schools from fuzzy school names

# Example usage

	from ct_schools import schools

	# returns a data frame with the closest match
	# df contains data from:
	#     https://data.ct.gov/Education/CT-Public-Schools/3z9z-e275
	# but splits out the lat long from the address, which for some
	# reason is concatenated in this table
	# so you get these extra columns:
	#    lat_lng, a typical lat, long tuple
	#    lat, latitude by itself
	#    lng, longitude by itself
	
	print schools.school_by_name("Shepau Valley", closest=True)
